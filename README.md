# WWebJS REST API

REST API wrapper for the [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) library, providing an easy-to-use interface to interact with the WhatsApp Web platform. 
It is designed to be used as a docker container, scalable, secure, and easy to integrate with other non-NodeJS projects.

This project is a fork of [whatsapp-api](https://github.com/chrishubert/whatsapp-api). As the project was abandoned by the original author, all future improvements will be in this repo.

The project is a work in progress: star it, create issues, features or pull requests ❣️

**NOTE**: I can't guarantee you will not be blocked by using this method, although it has worked for me. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.

## Quick Start with Docker

[![dockeri.co](https://dockerico.blankenship.io/image/avoylenko/wwebjs-api)](https://hub.docker.com/r/avoylenko/wwebjs-api)

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avoylenko/wwebjs-api.git
cd wwebjs-api
```

3. Run the Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up
```
4. Visit http://localhost:3000/session/start/ABCD

5. Scan the QR on your console using WhatsApp mobile app -> Linked Device -> Link a Device (it may take time to setup the session)

1. Handle multiple client sessions (session data saved locally), identified by unique id

2. All endpoints may be secured by a global API key

3. On server start, all existing sessions are restored

4. Set messages automatically as read

5. Disable any of the callbacks

6. Filter message webhooks by specific chat/group IDs

7. Easy chat/group ID discovery with trigger strings

## Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avoylenko/wwebjs-api.git
cd wwebjs-api
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

**Note:** To use the latest edge version of whatsapp-web.js directly from GitHub (with the latest features and fixes), modify the `package.json` dependency:

```json
"whatsapp-web.js": "github:pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js#main"
```

Then run `npm install` again. Be aware that edge versions may contain unstable features.

3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the required environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
npm run start
```

5. Access the API at `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing

Run the test suite with the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Documentation

API documentation can be found in the [`swagger.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avoylenko/wwebjs-api/main/swagger.json) file. See this file directly into [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avoylenko/wwebjs-api/main/swagger.json) or any other OpenAPI-compatible tool to view and interact with the API documentation.

This documentation is straightforward if you are familiar with whatsapp-web.js library (https://docs.wwebjs.dev/)
If you are still confused - open an issue and I'll improve it.

Also, there is an option to run the documentation endpoint locally by setting the `ENABLE_SWAGGER_ENDPOINT` environment variable. Restart the service and go to `/api-docs` endpoint to see it.

By default, all callback events are delivered to the webhook defined with the `BASE_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable.
This can be overridden by setting the `*_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable, where `*` is your sessionId.
For example, if you have the sessionId defined as `DEMO`, the environment variable must be `DEMO_WEBHOOK_URL`.

By setting the `DISABLED_CALLBACKS` environment variable you can specify what events you are **not** willing to receive on your webhook.

By setting the `ALLOWED_MESSAGE_CHAT_IDS` environment variable you can filter message webhooks to only specific chat or group IDs. This is useful when you only want to receive notifications from certain contacts or groups. If not set or empty, all messages will trigger webhooks.

Example:
```bash
# Only receive message webhooks from these chat/group IDs
ALLOWED_MESSAGE_CHAT_IDS=1234567890@c.us|9876543210@c.us|120363123456789012@g.us
```

### Discovering Chat/Group IDs

To easily discover chat or group IDs, use the `LISTEN_CHAT_ID` feature:

1. Set a unique trigger string in your `.env` file:
```bash
LISTEN_CHAT_ID=!getchatid
```

2. Restart your server

3. Send the trigger string (`!getchatid`) from any WhatsApp chat or group

4. Check your console - you'll see a formatted output with the chat ID:
```
================================================================================
🔍 CHAT ID DETECTED!
================================================================================
📱 Type: Contact
🆔 Chat ID: 1234567890@c.us
👤 From: John Doe
📅 Timestamp: 2026-01-28T12:34:56.789Z
================================================================================
💡 Add this to ALLOWED_MESSAGE_CHAT_IDS: 1234567890@c.us
================================================================================
```

5. Copy the Chat ID and add it to `ALLOWED_MESSAGE_CHAT_IDS` if needed

By setting the `ENABLE_WEBHOOK` environment to `FALSE` you can disable webhook dispatching. This will help you if you want to switch to websocket method(see below).

### Scanning QR code

In order to validate a new WhatsApp Web instance you need to scan the QR code using your mobile phone. Official documentation can be found at (https://faq.whatsapp.com/1079327266110265/?cms_platform=android) page. The service itself delivers the QR code content as a webhook event or you can use the REST endpoints (`/session/qr/:sessionId` or `/session/qr/:sessionId/image` to get the QR code as a png image). 

### WebSocket mode
The service can dispatch realtime events through websocket connection. By default, the websocket is not activated, so you need manually set the `ENABLE_WEBSOCKET` environment variable to activate it. The server activates a new websocket instance per each active session. The websocket path is `/ws/:sessionId`, where sessionId is your configured session name. The websocket supports ping/pong scheme to keep the socket running.
The below example shows how to receive the events for **test** session.
```
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:3000/ws/test');

ws.on('message', (data) => {
    // consume the events
});
```

## Deploy to Production

- Load the docker image in docker-compose, or your Kubernetes environment
- Disable the `ENABLE_LOCAL_CALLBACK_EXAMPLE` environment variable
- Set the `API_KEY` environment variable to protect the REST endpoints
- Run periodically the `/api/terminateInactiveSessions` endpoint to prevent useless sessions to take up space and resources(only in case you are not in control of the sessions)
